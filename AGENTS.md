# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
Guidance for agents working on the POSPal marketing site.

## Scope
- Marketing site only (static HTML/CSS/JS in this repo).
- Use MARKETING_PLAN.md as the source of truth.

## Objectives
- Primary: drive traffic to the demo.
- Secondary: drive downloads of webstud.exe (installer).
- Emphasize 30-day free trial with no info required.

## Audience
- Greek hospitality businesses (cafes, restaurants, beach bars, food trucks, seasonal).
- Decision makers: owners/managers/operators.

## Positioning
- POSPal is a kitchen/order workflow tool.
- It runs alongside existing fiscal POS systems.
- It does NOT handle the fiscal layer.

## Messaging pillars
- All-in-one workflow (tables, simple mode, QR menu included).
- Modern UI with clear pricing.
- Direct subscription; no middleman; cancel anytime.

## CTA rules
- Primary CTA: Demo.
- Secondary CTA: Download webstud.exe.
- Do NOT link to POSPal.exe directly.
- Use pospal-artifacts as the download host (URL TBD).

## Content rules
- Greek-only public copy (English internal notes are OK).
- Avoid naming competitors.
- Avoid claims about compliance or fines.
- Keep statements factual and non-comparative.

## Legal/clarity note
- Include a "not a fiscal POS" note in FAQ + pricing footnote + footer (only when approved).

## Asset rules
- Do not reference missing assets.
- Prefer static/ for new assets.
- Keep links and sitemap updated when pages change.

## Workflow constraints
- Do not edit the website without explicit approval.
- Draft copy/structure first, then implement after approval.

## Testing
- No automated tests required (static site).
