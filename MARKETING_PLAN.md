## POSPal Marketing Plan (Working Draft)

### 1) Goals (TBD)
- Primary goal: distribute `webstud.exe` (installer that downloads all app files and enables auto-updates) from the public `pospal-artifacts` repo.
- Secondary goals: keep a working demo and promote a 30-day free trial with no info required.
- Target conversion action: download `webstud.exe` (primary) and visit demo (secondary).
- Time horizon: TBD.

### 2) Audience (TBD)
- Primary segments: hospitality businesses in Greece (cafes, restaurants, beach bars, food trucks, seasonal venues).
- Business size / seasonality: all sizes, including seasonal operations.
- Decision makers: owners, managers, or operators who control tooling and budgets.
- Key pain points: distributor-led pricing/maintenance, fragmented tools, unclear costs, slow setup.

### 3) Positioning (TBD)
- One-sentence positioning: all-in-one kitchen order + QR menu tool with modern UI and a direct monthly subscription.
- Differentiators: transparent pricing, no middleman, all features included (table mode + simple mode + QR menu).
- Market framing (internal): not competing with big fiscal POS vendors; competing with "whatever barely works."
- Market insight: Greek F&B tech is compliance-driven, not user-driven; POSPal is the user-driven layer.
- Positioning rule: POSPal is a kitchen/order workflow tool that can run alongside existing compliance POS systems.
- Compliance clarity: POSPal does not handle the fiscal layer; it focuses on ordering + kitchen flow and can run alongside the fiscal POS.
- Competitive alternatives: distributor-sold PDA/POS tools with maintenance plans and opaque pricing.
- Proof points: demo and screenshots (no testimonials yet; early-stage startup).

### 4) Offer & Pricing (TBD)
- Plan name(s): POSPal Subscription.
- Price point(s): EUR 20 / month.
- Trial details: 30-day free trial, no information required.
- Cancellation terms: cancel anytime, just like common subscriptions (Netflix/Spotify).

### 5) Messaging Pillars (TBD)
- Pillar 1: all-in-one workflow (table mode, simple mode, QR menu included).
- Pillar 2: modern UI with clear, honest pricing.
- Pillar 3: direct subscription, no distributor or maintenance plan.

### 6) Funnel & CTA (TBD)
- Top-of-funnel: home page + SEO.
- Mid-funnel: demo and installation guide.
- Bottom-of-funnel: download installer and start trial.
- Primary CTA: open the demo.
- Secondary CTA: download `webstud.exe` (link TBD).

### 7) Website Plan (TBD)
- Key pages: Home, Demo, Installation Guide, Guides.
- Page order / nav: Home, Demo, Guides, Installation, Download.
- Required sections on home: what it is/is not (not a legal POS), features, pricing, trial, demo, download.
- SEO targets: Greek hospitality order management, QR menu, PDA ordering, kitchen workflow.
 - Above-the-fold feature labels (working): "Λειτουργία τραπεζιών", "Απλή λειτουργία (χωρίς τραπέζια)", "QR Μενού".

### 8) Assets & Proof (TBD)
- Testimonials / quotes: none yet.
- Screenshots / demos: demo page, app screenshots.
- Logos / badges: none yet.
- Case studies: none yet.

### 9) Metrics (TBD)
- North-star metric: installer downloads.
- Supporting metrics: demo visits, installation guide views.
- Baselines (if any): none yet.

### 9.1) Product Opportunities (Internal, Not Promised)
- Pre-order + messaging POS: orders via Messenger/Viber/WhatsApp, auto-parsed and queued, fiscalized later.
- Back-of-house clarity: kitchen-only views, bottleneck detection, re-fire logic, staff accountability via UID.
- Owner-centric dashboards: focus on truth (who cancels, who delays, where the kitchen blocks).
- Offline-first workflow: stable operation when internet is flaky or down.

### 10) Risks & Open Questions
- [ ] Pricing phrasing and trial messaging
- [ ] CTA destination and flow
- [ ] Proof points (data, testimonials)
- [ ] Visual direction
- [ ] Clear "not a legal POS" explanation without hurting conversion
- [ ] Hosting location for `webstud.exe` (pospal-artifacts public repo)
- [ ] `webstud.exe` public URL (pending)

### 11) Next Actions
- Finalize positioning statement
- Confirm download host for `webstud.exe` (pospal-artifacts public repo)
- Add homepage note: not a legal POS (FAQ + pricing footnote + footer)
- Update site copy + CTAs
- Fix asset/link integrity + sitemap
